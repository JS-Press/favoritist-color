# Favoritist Color

A website which allows users to create personal ratings of all of the CSS colors, and keeps track of the current highest-rated color.

# Installation and Usage

* Clone this repo, and open the directory in two terminal tabs. 
* In either tab, create & seed the database by running in your terminal the command "rails db:reset"
* Run "rails s" in the first tab (This will start the server), and run "npm start --prefix client" in the second. The order matters, and the second will ask you to agree to running the frontend on a separate local port than the first.
* The app should be running. Create an account and then you can start rating colors!
